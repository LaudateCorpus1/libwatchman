This is a C interface to watchman
(https://www.github.com/facebook/watchman).

Watchman is a wrapper around inotify, kevents, etc.  

Using libwatchman is very straightforward: establish a connection with
watchman_connect, do some commands, then disconnect with
watchman_connection_close. These functions handle memory
management for you.

To set up a watch on a directoy, use watchman_ensure_watch.

To make a query, first construct an expression using the
watchman_*_expression functions, then use watchman_query.
You have to free expressions yourself, using watchman_free_expression,
but freeing an expression will free all of its child expressions.
